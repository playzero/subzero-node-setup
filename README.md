# Subzero-Alphaville Testnet Node
#### 5 minutes.
This will show you how to run a simple node and get rewards for helong the network.
Advanced users you can follow the _VALIDATOR_ setup tutorial: [Validator Turorial](README_VALIDATOR.md)

<br/>

---

## Goal:
At the end of this tutorial you will have a node online and synced to the network.
here will be snapshots taken regularly to calculate rewards


## üõ†Ô∏è Setup:
you will need one of the following:

### azure
*oneclick azure*

### digitalcoean
*digitalocean vm'

### laptop/other vm
all you need is

## 2: Naming your node:

There is a file named `.env` in the repository the content is quite manageable
This is the name that will show up in the telemetry

```
NAME=ExampleNode
```

## 2: Testing the Node:

We can now easily start the node with `docker-compose up`.
Once we verified this works we can actually start the node for long term production:

## 3: Running the Node in production:

With `docker-compose up -d` the process runs in the background.
We can always open the logs with `docker-compose logs -f`
`docker-compose down` to stop the container

## Updating the Node:
```
docker-compose down
docker-compose pull
docker-comnpose up -d
```
