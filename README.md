## 2 - Naming your node:

There is a file named `.env` in the repository the content is quite manageable
This is the name that will show up in the telemetry

```
NAME=ExampleNode
```

## 2 - Testing the Node:

We can now easily start the node with `docker-compose up`.
Once we verified this works we can actually start the node for long term production:

---

## 3 - Running the Node in production:

With `docker-compose up -d` the process runs in the background.
We can always open the logs with `docker-compose logs -f`
`docker-compose down` to stop the container

## 4 - Updating the Node:
```
docker-compose down
docker-compose pull
docker-comnpose up -d
```
