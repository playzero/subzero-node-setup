<details><summary>Subdomain | In short a reference from a dns to our server(ip)</summary>
<br/>
There are several ways to get a subdomain. I will show you 2 ways

<br/>

- You can buy a domain from a provider like https://www.namecheap.com/
- There are also free providers that quickly provide you with a subdomain, for example https://www.noip.com/remote-access

<h3>Namecheap</h3>

1.  Buy a domain you like.
2.  DNS Config -> Here is a nice tutorial for your settings (Subdomain that points to an IP address
    ): https://www.namecheap.com/support/knowledgebase/article.aspx/9776/2237/how-to-create-a-subdomain-for-my-domain

<h3>Noip</h3>

1.  Create an account
2.  Create DNS HOST (A) Record -> Here is a nice tutorial: https://www.noip.com/support/knowledgebase/configure-ip-hostname/

## 1 - Create the keys Babe and Gran for the node
---

Preparation:
- (generate an address and save the seed phrase for example with: https://polkadot.js.org/extension/)
- For the key type babe we use the public key in SR25519 format.
- For the key type gran we use the public key in ED25519 format.
- Suri | Wallet Seed Phrase | Mnemonic (Mostly a set of 12 words)

‚ö†Ô∏è If you haven't noticed, the format is different for gran and babe (SR, ED) ‚ö†Ô∏è

<br/>

## The Short Way
#### use our discord bot faucet-chan (and get some PLAY tokens while your at it)
---

### ZERO-FAUCET Discord:
https://discord.gg/d94Hrz4udy

To get the SR25519 and ED25519 infromation for Address
```!fc subkey <Address>```

Example
```!fc subkey 5GrwvaEF5zXb26Fz9rcQpDWS57CtERHpNehXCPcNoHGKutQY```

Also, be sure to Get tokens to play and test
```!fc get <Address>```

<br/>

## The Long Way
<details><summary>Compile Subkey Yourself</summary>
How do we get the SR25519 and ED25519 public key from our suri:

> As an example I use `detect silk hidden item media foster brief maple proof belt absurd genius` as suri

We can get more detailed information about our suri with the <a href="https://substrate.dev/docs/en/knowledgebase/integrate/subkey">subkey tool:</a>

```
curl https://getsubstrate.io -sSf | bash -s -- --fast
source ~/.cargo/env
cargo install --force subkey --git https://github.com/paritytech/substrate --version 2.0.1 --locked
```

### Keys

SR25519(babe):

> subkey inspect --scheme sr25519 "detect silk hidden item media foster brief maple proof belt absurd genius"

```
Secret phrase `detect silk hidden item media foster brief maple proof belt absurd genius` is account:
  Secret seed:      0x1aed0fdf143ae27af37f3d0e7025733756a2c45a62c887216871074a2efcc162

## 2 - Now that we have our public keys we need to create 2 files in the folder ./keys
---

> As an example I use `detect silk hidden item media foster brief maple proof belt absurd genius` as suri

The end result will look like this but with YOUR key information

./keys
<br/>
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ 626162653ee10e31a28caefe0fb45c33aa5f79d83758a2006abcd6bf387b21025f7ad720
<br/>
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ 6772616e216c3621cfe4f2a0877d6090a8c9aa8e5efc28fe830dfcbe02e289912cb9e228
<br/>

---

<br/>

### The first file is for babe:


Create a file with the name `62616265` concatenated with your public key in sr25519 format you acquired in the previous step (babe)

> My file is named 626162653ee10e31a28caefe0fb45c33aa5f79d83758a2006abcd6bf387b21025f7ad720

Now all that remains is to write our suri in the file.

> The content of my file is `"detect silk hidden item media foster brief maple proof belt absurd genius"` ‚ö†Ô∏èThere must be a " before and after your suri ‚ö†Ô∏è

---

<br/>

### The second file is for gran:


Create a file with the name `6772616e` concatenated with your public key in ed25519 format you acquired in the previous step (gran)

> My file is named 6772616e216c3621cfe4f2a0877d6090a8c9aa8e5efc28fe830dfcbe02e289912cb9e228

Now all that remains is to write our suri in the file.

> The content of my file is `"detect silk hidden item media foster brief maple proof belt absurd genius"` ‚ö†Ô∏èThere must be a " before and after your suri ‚ö†Ô∏è

---

The folder `./keys` should now contain 2 files

./keys
<br/>
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ 626162653ee10e31a28caefe0fb45c33aa5f79d83758a2006abcd6bf387b21025f7ad720
<br/>
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ 6772616e216c3621cfe4f2a0877d6090a8c9aa8e5efc28fe830dfcbe02e289912cb9e228

<br/>
<br/>

---
## 3 - The node needs a name:
---

There is a file named `.env` in the repository the content is quite manageable
This is the name that will show up in the telemetry

```
NAME=ExampleNode
```
<br/>
<br/>

---
## 4 - Configuration of our subdomain:
---

The file location is `.\config\node.subdomain.conf`.

We actually only need to edit this part:

```
  # TODO replace node with your subdomain
    server_name node.*;
```

Example:

> We have created a subdomain at noip with the name `magic-node`.
>
> Then our url would be something like `magic-node.ddns.net`
>
> So we change `node.*` to `magic-node.*` actually quite simple.

<br/>
<br/>

---
## 5 - Letsencrypt configs
---

The file location is `.\config\letsencrypt-env`.

We are actually only interested in 2 entries

```
URL=example.com
SUBDOMAINS=myNode
```

> If we take again the example from above we have to change the entries as follows
>
> URL=`ddns.net`
>
> SUBDOMAINS=magic-node

<br/>
<br/>

---
## 6 - Start the Node:
---

We can now easily start the node with `docker-compose up`.

> Tip:
>
> With `docker-compose up -d` the process runs in the background.
>
> We can always open the logs with `docker-compose logs -f`
>
> `docker-compose down` to stop the container
